**Happy new year people!!! ;)**

I wish you all a great 2007 full of fun and happiness and all the other good stuff (new hardware comes to mind).  
23C3 finished two days ago, it was really great fun with great talks and great people (yeah, Polish guy living
in the USA, from the university near Atlanta, you know who you are ;) ).  
Now we've passed yesterday by visiting Berlin and at the moment we're connected through the Hostel's connection...
It's depressing to know it's at least twice as fast as my home DSL.  
By the way, all this convinced me to come to FOSDEM 07, so be prepared to know chtekk (or be scared, that depends).
