I've been a long time advocate and user of [Mozilla Thunderbird][1] as email client, but with version 3 the
already bloated software just got worse, and most of its new features were just useless to me, so I started
searching for a much more lightweight graphical email client, and found [claws-mail][2] to be a perfect fit.  
I now use it since a few months and am really happy with it, it's blazing fast and really only provides
useful features at its core, while leaving more up to plugins.  
One such plugin I use is [RSSyl][3], which aggregates your feeds like a bunch of mail folders, and each
entry is presented like an email.  
There even is a [Windows port][4] of claws-mail (together with gpg4win), so even Windows users can try it!
