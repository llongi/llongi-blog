Well hi! :)

I've just set up this blog now on chtekk.longitekk.com, a server much faster than the old chtekk.homelinux.net
(wich now anyway redirects you here), and hope it will be added to the [Gentoo blog aggregator][1] soon.

Yup, I'm officially a Gentoo Dev now, with a [chtekk@gentoo.org][2] email address et all, I must say this makes me
really happy, and I hope to be able to contribute to Gentoo a lot, working mainly on PHP (especially the new
dev-lang/php & co. packages) and also on Apache and Web-Apps.

I usually hang out in #gentoo-apache on irc.freenode.net, so that's where you can reach me most of the time,
or via email. Well, I'll close this "intro" blog post now, stay tuned for more exciting news! ;)
