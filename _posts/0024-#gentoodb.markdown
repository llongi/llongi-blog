\#gentoo-db has just opened its (virtual) doors (or windows or terminals, depends on what IRC client you use).

The new channel is intented to provide a platform for discussions, concerning both support and development,
centering on Gentoo and databases.  
At the moment Gentoo MySQL and PostgreSQL people hang out there, but it's my hope to see other developers
and/or teams that maintain database-related packages for Gentoo (Firebird, Oracle, SQLite, BerkeleyDB, ...)
join too, as well as users with experience in SQL and database administration, or just people interested in
databases and their uses.
