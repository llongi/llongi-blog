A bit of time has elapsed since the last Gentoo+PHP related blog entry, so I'll update you about it's status
with this one.  
dev-lang/php was updated and works well, 5.1.1 is ready for Portage, indeed we're adding new and updated PECL
etc. packages to the Portage tree lately, but we have to wait until [bug 115887][1] is fixed before we can add
the new dev-lang/php packages and eclasses themselves to Portage, so I hope this will happen really soon!  
After that we'll leave the new-style PHP packages about one week still in ~ARCH, and start stabling them,
beginning with x86 (we'll open a bug about that), probably on the first/second of the new year.  
I hope you all appreciate the new PHP packages, they work very well here, and if you appreciate the work
we're doing on them, [here][2]'s my Amazon wishlist if anyone's intersted. Merry christmas and a happy new year!
