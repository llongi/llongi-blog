Here some old hardware I have to sell, everything should still work, but there's no guarantee!

* Texas Instruments, **"Voyage 200 Calculator"** (good condition, cables+manuals+batteries, tested) (100 CHF)
* Huawei, **"HSDPA USB Modem E220"** (5 CHF)

(Update: the above are the only two things I'm keeping around or haven't sold yet. Contact me!)
