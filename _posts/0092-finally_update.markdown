The last post was in 2013, and the one before that inaugurated 2012 with a "Happy New Year!".
That's several Happy New Year's since then, and much has changed in the meantime.

I moved from Dietikon to Zürich in 2014. New apartment, new roommates.
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Informatics, Software-Systems in 2015. Finally.
I started working for a great company in 2013, iniLabs Ltd., a spin-off from the Institute of Neuroinformatics
here at the University of Zürich, that works on neuromorphic hardware, specifically bio-inspired vision sensors.
Had the opportunity to work with IBM's TrueNorth development team on integrating the sensors with their platform
in 2013-2014 as part of the DARPA SyNAPSE project. Met lots of great people, went several times to California (US),
partecipated in the 2015 Telluride (Colorado, US) Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop, met even more awesome people.
Two fun years working on embedded hardware, low-level C libraries, VHDL FPGA logic and Java GUIs, everything I ever
wanted. And it's all set to continue.
On the open-source front, I started contributing to usb4java in July 2013 due to my work at iniLabs, where we use it
extensively in the jAER project to talk to the vision sensors in a performant and platform-independant way.
Also almost all of the code I've worked on is available openly from the jAER project.
In 2013 I moved my own projects from self-hosted SVN to Git & GitHub, including the source for this blog. Very happy.

Photos of San Francisco, Colorado, New York, Yellowstone, London and others can be found in the gallery.
I took most of them during the 2015 road-trip through central US with my friend Diederik Moeys.

I've gone through all the pages in the blog here and updated them, so they should reflect current reality better.
I'm hoping to keep the blog more up-to-date in the future. I've promised myself I'd use it to document the
resurrection of my oldest hobby: N-scale model trains. More on that soon.
