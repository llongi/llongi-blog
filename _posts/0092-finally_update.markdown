The last post was in 2013, and the one before that inaugurated 2012 with a "Happy New Year!".
That's several Happy New Year's since then, and much has changed in the meantime.

I moved from Dietikon to Zürich in 2014. New apartment, new roommates.
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Informatics, Software-Systems in 2015. Finally.

I started working for a great company in 2013, [iniLabs Ltd.][1], a spin-off from the [Institute of Neuroinformatics (INI)][2]
here at the University of Zürich, that works on neuromorphic hardware, specifically bio-inspired vision sensors.
Had the opportunity to work with [IBM's TrueNorth][3] development team on integrating the sensors with their platform
in 2013-2014 as part of the DARPA SyNAPSE project. Met lots of great people, went several times to California (US),
partecipated in the [2015 Telluride][4] (Colorado, US) Neuromorphic Engineering Workshop, met even more awesome people.
Two fun years working on embedded hardware, low-level C libraries, VHDL FPGA logic and Java GUIs, everything I ever
wanted. And it's all set to continue, as we're currently expanding our offering of neuromorphic devices.

On the open-source front, I started contributing to [usb4java][5] in July 2013 due to my work at iniLabs, where we use it
extensively in the jAER project to talk to the vision sensors in a performant and platform-independant way, as well
as in the Flashy project, a tool to update firmware and logic on our sensor devices.
Also almost all of the code I've worked on is available openly from the [jAER project][6] or the [iniLabs GitHub][7] pages.
In 2013 I moved [my own projects][8] from self-hosted SVN to Git & GitHub, including the source for this blog. Great service.

After over a decade of self-hosting, I moved everything over to Google Apps. Very happy with not having to care about
any of that anymore, I just didn't have the time for server maintainance.

Photos of San Francisco, Colorado, New York, Yellowstone, London and other places I visited can be found in the new
[gallery][9], powered by Google Drive.
I took most of them during the 2015 road-trip through central US with my good friend Diederik Moeys, a PhD here at INI.

I've gone through all the pages in the blog here and updated them, so they should reflect current reality better.
I'm hoping to keep the blog more up-to-date in the future. I've promised myself I'd use it to document the
resurrection of my oldest hobby: N-scale model trains. More on that soon.
