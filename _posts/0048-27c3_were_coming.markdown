Again this year I'll be present at the [Chaos Communication Congress][1] in Berlin, along with a bunch of
friends. I've been to 23C3, 25C3 and now it's time for 27C3. I really hope that it's gonne be awesome like
the last times, the venue is really great, and the talks are usually very interesting and diverse. This
year they changed how tickets are handled, but that shouldn't be a problem.
