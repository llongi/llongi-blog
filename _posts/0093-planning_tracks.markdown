So, the first step should always be planning. And in the case of model layouts, shape
and size are the first things that should be determined.
In the [newly free room][5], I can dedicate a rectangular surface of about 2.30 x 1.20 meters
to my hobby. While more than twice the size of my very first layout in 1999, which stood
at 1.20 x 0.90 meters, this is not incredibly big, only about 2.8 square meters in which
to play. Also the new layout requires much larger curve radiuses, due to most of my
rolling stock being big locomotives (Big Boy, DDA40X, Ae 8/14). And anything runs better
on bigger radiuses, always. Also, I've always wanted a turn-table, so there will have to
be space for it somewhere. And that thing occupies a lot of space.
So I quickly decided to go 3D and add multiple levels, to maximize efficient space usage:
- Level 1 is going to be the staging area. It will have the turn-table and space to
leave the trains when not in use, as well as some way to turn them around (a loop).
- Level 2 is an idea I had to put in something extra, and recreate the underground S-Bahn
station found in ZÃ¼rich HB, probably the single train station I've frequented the most
in my life. From a layout PoV very simple, but rebuilding the actual decor will provide
to be quite a challenge.
- Level 3, on top, will be a "normal" fantasy layout, with stations, mountains, houses,
and so on. There will be a rack railway going up the mountain(s).
Now that the main idea and concepts were decided on, the detailed planning had to happen:
what tracks are laid out exactly how?, how do we go from one level to another?, slopes?
As a kid I did try out different track layouts using a computer software called Raily, so
I knew that software to do this existed, and in the last 15 years it could only have got
better (at least I hoped so!). Indeed, [several][1] pieces of software do exist, but most are
commercial only or have, to me, weird interfaces. On the freeware market, two stood out:
[XTrackCAD][2] and [SCARM][3]. In the end I decided to use SCARM, as it had a, to me, much
more intuitive and simple to use interface for the kind of things I wanted to do.
XTrackCAD has the advantage of being cross-platform and running even on Linux, but starting
a Windows VM to run SCARM was just so much easier to get started with.
In the end I managed to finalize [Levels 1][4] and 2 easily, with a spiral loop connecting all
three levels. Level 3 is still fluid, but at the current pace I have at least another year
to think about it. I'll expand on the Level 1 design in another post.
