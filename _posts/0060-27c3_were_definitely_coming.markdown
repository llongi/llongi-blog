Yeah, me and a friend will be present at this year's [Chaos Communication Congress][1].  
I'm keeping up my "every-two-years" schedule, went to the 23rd, 25th, and now 27th Congress.  
I managed to get tickets at the last sales window, thankfully, since we already got the rooms and train
reserved and paid for before we even knew that they changed the ticket selling system this year...  
So I missed the first two pre-sales, but managed to get two tickets on the last one... It would not have been
fun to go to Berlin and just watch the Congress from outside!  
We'll be in Berlin from the evening of the 26th to the morning of the 2nd, which means we'll also be celebrating
New Year's Eve in the big city of Berlin, that ought to be lots of fun! ;)  
Let me know if you'll be there too, see you there!
