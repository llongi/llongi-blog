This week's [Rig][1] status update:

* MLOCK/MRWLOCK: added functions to discover if a lock is held or not, clarified documentation wrt recursive
  locking, and fixed a possible wrap-around bug in MLOCK and an incorrect error return in MRWLOCK
* SMR: ported it to use MLOCK instead of its own micro-lock scheme
* Changed rig_thread_id() to start at 1 for the main thread and not to use 0 at all. This aligns it with some
  OS implementations, leads to better performance, and fixes a bug in MLOCK, which uses the 0 ID to signal
  "no-thread-owns-me"
* Changed default hash algorithm to MurmurHash 3
* Added support for tests, using the great [Check framework for C Unit-Testing][2], and using CMake's CTest
  to run them
* Added optional testing support to the Gentoo ebuild (USE=test + FEATURES=test)
