Seeing as all exams for this semester are finally done, today I busied myself by sorting all the accumulated
papers and notes. Since they might be useful to somebody in years to come, I decided to scan all the
Zusammenfassungen (summaries) I did during the last two semesters at UZH and post them on-line.  
I've created [a separate page][1] to hold all my UZH related work, that I'll update as the years go on.
