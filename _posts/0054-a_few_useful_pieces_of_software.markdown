Continuing my series about useful software I use daily, I decided to finish it up quickly by just posting a few
names, links and descriptions.

* [XMonad][1] - tiling window manager, totally changed how I interact with my desktop, the keyboard is a much
  more efficient way to do things ;)
* [LLVM][2] + [Clang][3] - new virtual machine / compiler infrastructure and C/C++ compiler based on it, much
  faster than GCC and with much more helpful error messages, but not with all of its extensions and features
* [Eclipse][4] - **the** open-source IDE, makes programming faster and more fun!
* [CDT for Eclipse][5] - C/C++ plug-in for Eclipse, makes developing C projects that much easier
* [PyDev for Eclipse][6] - Python plug-in, to support your favorite scripting language better ;)
* [SSHFS][7] - mounts remote file-systems over SSH, providing strong encryption and authentication (uses the
  [FUSE][8] framework on Linux)

I'll soon start posting about my latest software project, Rig, which I have been working on for quite a while, so stay tuned!

**Quick events guide:**

* 4 November, big [ASTAZ][9] party (aka. Free-Alcohol) @ Dynamo Zürich
* 4-18 November, [ExpoVina 2010][10] @ Bürkliplatz Zürich
