As the title says, PHP 4.4.2 and PHP 5.1.2 were just added to Portage, enjoy!  
During the last week dev-php/PEAR-PEAR was also updated to 1.4.8 which should hopefully fix all the problems
you may have been experiencing with access violations etc. when installing some PEAR packages.  
You can also find PHP 5.1.3RC1 in the [PHP Overlay][] now for testing, enjoy that too.
