Adieu old-style PHP (dev-php/php et all)...

One of many ways to say that, as I'm posting this, I'm cvs up'ing the affected directories to start the removal
of the already masked old-style PHP packages, as announced one month ago.  
For all the ones that didn't yet migrate... Well, migrate NOW! :)  
And generally, enjoy the fact that "emerge php" will now install dev-lang/php, and you won't have to specify
the category anymore.
