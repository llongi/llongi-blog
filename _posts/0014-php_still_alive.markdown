PHP in Portage is still alive! ;)

5.1.2 and 4.4.2 should soon be ready, I'm getting a couple of vServers ready to test that and make some
changes, as I was without a proper dev-machine for ~ 3 weeks now. A big thanks to the Gentoo-VPS project,
setting up vServers with the ebuilds in Portage and the HowTos is really easy and works great!

As a sidenote, I added the minutes of this month's PHP herd meeting to the [PHP Overlay][] page as well as
the full IRC log, next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, the 7th of March, 2006, at 19.00 UTC.  
I apologize for the delay in getting the minutes up and the new PHP versions out, but lately I was really
busy with school, now I'll have a lot more time at my disposal during the next few weeks and I can break
and test stuff much easier, thanks to the vServers.
