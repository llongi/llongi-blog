I've left [ETH Zürich][1] behind me, as I really didn't feel their theory-heavy curriculum to be right for me,
and I'm now a student at the [University of Zürich][2], following the "Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
RO 2008" courses, specializing in "Software-Systems", which I hope will be a much more practice-oriented course.  
The first year is together with the students specializing in "Business Informatics", so I also have a few
business-related classes, such as Financial Accounting and IT in Companies, which I don't mind, as I find them
quite interesting and useful. After the first week I can honestly say I like the place, there's a very friendly
athmosphere and I've met a lot of nice and fun new people.
