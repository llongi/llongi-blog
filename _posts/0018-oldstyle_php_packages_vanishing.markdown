Your friendly service announcement:

> The PHP Herd announces that the old-style PHP packages, which were unsupported and deprecated for months, are
> finally going away.  
> After months of work, the team considers the new dev-lang/php package and the related dev-php[4,5]/ categories
> fully ready for production use, and encourage all users to upgrade.  
> Helpful informations can be found at the [PHP project's pages][1], along with [a HOWTO][2] regarding the migration
> to dev-lang/php.  
> The old-style PHP packages (dev-php/php, dev-php/php-cgi, dev-php/mod_php, dev-php/PECL-\*, and older
> dev-php/PEAR-\* packages) will be package.masked on Wednesday, 19 April 2006, and removed from the Portage
> tree about a month later.
