Went to the Warm-Up party at ETHZ's StuZ² yesterday evening, not that bad, but not really that great either,
the place was a bit cramped at times and they really need to add some better ventilation system, it was
stifling inside most of the time!  
Now a study-laden week-end is awaiting me, yay...  
Next week:

* Thursday, [ESF 2010][1] at ETH Hönggerberg, biggest swiss students party, everyone who doesn't know what
  to do that evening, go there!
* Friday, [Inkognito 2010][2] at Härterei, it's our students association's semester-party
