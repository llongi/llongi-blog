I've bought lots of hardware in my life, some better, some worse...  
But my last buy, a [Samsung SP-H03][1] pico-projector really leaves me speechless.  
I really didn't expect the tiny, low-cost LED projector to perform so well in practice...  
The image is clear and very watchable, you just have to turn down the lights some, but that was to be expected.
It also has a lot of features and connection possibilities, which all work very well, like just attaching a
USB stick to play movies off. And the built-in speaker isn't that bad, you can clearly understand dialogue,
but of course an external 5.1 system is better for sound. Attaching it to my PS3 worked without problems, and
I tell you, playing Colin McRae Dirt 2 on a 60" screen is awesome! As is lying back on your bed and projecting
the latest Castle episode on the ceiling of your room.  
Being able to just project stuff anywhere using the battery is really cool, and the whole package just weighs
200-something grams; the fan is almost noiseless, you might hear it in a completely silent room while projecting
without sound (during a presentation for example) but that's it, as soon as you have any kind of sound, speakers,
a laptop-fan, whatever, you won't be able to hear it at all, and it doesn't disturb you any.  
I'm really very impressed by the price-performance ratio of this product, it was the cheapest projector available
and it works like a charm, and lots of other professional reviews pin it as one of the best pico projectors on
the market. Samsung wins again!  
To conclue [a video][2] I watched before buying it, I was a little skeptical, but now that I own it I can tell
you, what you see on that video is 100% doable in reality.
