Finally, PHP 5.1.1 and the new revisions for the other dev-lang/php versions are in the Portage tree. :)

Those should fix a lot of bugs and problems, especially with Hardened-PHP (updated to latest 0.4.8 release)
and GCC4 (bug in the CURL extension that made the compile fail).  
With those, we also now use app-admin/php-toolkit instead of app-admin/eselect-php, so you'll be required
to migrate to php-toolkit (just unmerge eselect-php and emerge php-toolkit), since eselect-php will soon
be removed from the tree.  
The [PHP Overlay][] was updated/cleaned accordingly. Enjoy PHP 5.1! ;)
