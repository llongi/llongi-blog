Here are a few Mozilla Firefox extensions I've really come to appreciate in my years of browsing the web,
they might be useful for you too:

* AdBlock Plus - you can't use the internet without it, as it blocks all those annoying banners and pop-ups
* NoScript - a must in today's age of malicious JavaScript & co., blocks the execution of scripts and other
  content until you approve it
* FAYT - get back the old "Find as you type" search-bar, with the prev/next buttons! No idea why they removed
  them ...
* Firefox Sync (formerly known as Mozilla Weave) - keeps your bookmarks, preferences etc. in sync while
  using differente computers, useful for us mobile students
* WebDeveloper - various tools of great value to website developers
