For those that don't read [LWN][1], [this is so awesome][2], an Ubuntu-Manga, about a high-school's sys-admin
club! Totally hilarious, and being a Manga, of course two thirds of the sys-admin club are cute girls, clearly
using Linux and MacOS X (in fact, the brunette works only on terminals and hates anything non-text-based),
while the lone dude is a Windows user.  
Just a little excerpt: "W-- What sorcery did you use?" (to install Ubuntu so quickly) "The magic of click
forward, click forward, and... click finish?" ROFL! And it just gets better. Have fun reading!
