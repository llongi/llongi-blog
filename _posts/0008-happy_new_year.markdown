Happy New Year to everyone! :)

This sure was an interesting year for me, with many unexpected turns, but all that definitely went well and
were liked on my part! ;)  
I hope for another great year with all of you and with Gentoo.  
Again, I wish a great 2006 to all of you!

P.S.: I hope to be able to add PHP 5.1.1 to the Portage tree during the next week, just waiting on
[bug 116975][1] to be fixed.
