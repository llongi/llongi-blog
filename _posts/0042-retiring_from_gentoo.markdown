I'm officially retiring as a Gentoo developer, simply because I've not really done anything in the last year
and will not be getting back into the swing of things anytime in the future, so I feel it's time to retire.  
It's been a fun 4.5 years, even if I wasn't present much as developer in the last 1.5 years, and I will
definitely continue using Gentoo as my distribution of choice, nothing will change that.
I've had the honor of getting to know some amazing people during those years, and improve a lot of my skills
and competences, and for that I'm grateful. See you all around!
