Towards the end of 2015, when I was looking at which big engines were even available
in N scale, I found the beautiful Union Pacific GTELs. Sadly, nobody had or was
producing them. Only H0 scale. So imagine my positive surprise when I ran that search
again this week and found out that the guys behind the H0 version also announced
an N scale version! I've already preordered engine #18 at ScaleTrains, yay!
If you like big american engines, check those guys out. It looks amazing!
