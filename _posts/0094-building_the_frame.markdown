So, first thing that had to be built: the frame.
I decided on wood, as it's much easier to work with "at home" than metal/aluminium supports.
I went for 12mm thick [high-quality birch plywood][1], as that was the best I could get from my local
retailer [Migros DoIt][2]. I wanted resistant, heavy wood, so as to avoid deformations.
The construction is carried by five thick (7cm) slats, each with a wheel on the underside, so
that the whole thing can be moved around the room, and it's then easily possible to access the
backside of the whole layout, which also means I could actually use that space. I early on
decided to add a fifth slat in the center, to help support the weigth and avoid any deformation
of the cross-bars. Every cross-bar (4-5cm thick) is connected to the main slats as well as
each-other through steel [angle brackets or T brackets][3].
First, I had to [smooth][4] all the wood I bought; it just looks better, and helps in avoiding
splinters. Given that we don't have any public space here to do this kind of work, I did it
inside the room. It worked out by covering everything and leaving the windows open, but still
turned out to be a little bit more of a mess than initially thought. I so wish apartment buildings
would have communal spaces with work benches and air filtration for handcraft, like you have
communal washing rooms or cellars. Maybe new constructions way outside my price range do have that.
I then assembled the [crossbars][5] for the first two [levels][6], as well as the five [vertical slats][7],
and then put everything together. Had to put a lot of thought into the length of the screws, so
that they wouldn't touch each-other inside of the wood. The battery-powered drill with screw
setting proved to be incredibly useful.
Each level's base is made up of [two plywood planes][8], as having one big plane would have
been impossible to transport and get into the elevator. They are screwed onto the supporting
crossbars. The level 1 plane has, as you can see, a circular hole; that's to hold the turntable.
The lowest level sits at 80cm from the floor, allowing easy access from below. Level 2 is 39cm
above it, with Level 3 another 14cm up.
