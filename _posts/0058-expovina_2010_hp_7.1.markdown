Went to [ExpoVina][1] again this year, awesome as always, great wines, great people and great company! ;)  
The port wines at [Amarela][2] were incredible, and as usual it isn't only wine you get to taste there.
Had to order the chocolate-pepper, yum!!! And the bread with the right olive oil... delightful!  
[Bindella][3] also got all the good Italian dessert wines, and "Vigna Senza Nome" was even at a reduced price!

On another note, I went to watch "Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows - Part 1" yesterday evening at the Abaton,
which thankfully has extremely comfortable seats, as I alternated between moments of sleepiness (thankfully much
fewer than in the 5th and 6th movies!), and moments of "Gaahh wtf eh?"... I admit to never having finished reading
book 7, as it just sucked so much, and the film reflects that, completely random items quest, coupled with teenage
angst, and let's add a few mythical artifacts just for fun, and don't get me started on the magic, that's probably
my biggest gripe with the HP films: the magic effects just SUCK, it's always just random lights and explosions
that do comparatively little damage (only cool explosion I saw was Hermione using Bombarda once, why don't you
always use it, if you know it, wtf? And Voldemort's lightning spell towards the end). Basically I find the magic
much too tame, I mean, if you can control energy and the elements, make it go Boom! more often... And the flying
black clouds of Death Eeaterness, the LOLZ, I can't remember anything in the books that justifies that... Will
have to wait till July 2011 for the second part, which I'll probably still watch in a masochistic attempt at
completing the set. :)  
In the end there thankfully is [fan-fiction][4], much of which I find better than the original books, and there
are other, much better fantasy series to keep one's self entertained, The Dresden Files, The Mistborn Trilogy,
and the king, The Lord of the Rings.
