Let's get back to blogging a little, now that I have some more time... ;)  
Last saturday I went to [FrOSCamp 2010][1] at [ETH Zürich][2] (my former college). The conference was quite
good with a few interesting talks, but it could have been publicized better, me and a friend of mine just
got wind of it by chance thanks to some online article, there was no info-mail to Computer Science students
for example, which could have helped increase the turnout...  
After the last talk me and a friend, who's just transferred from Lugano (TI) to Zürich to complete his Master
of Informatics in Distributed Systems at [ETHZ][2], went to the [Rote Fabrik][3] for a night of partying.
We choose the place pretty randomly, and since we never went there before, we didn't know what to expect at all.
And oh boy, did we choose well! The place is really awesome, it's an old factory made of red bricks (hence the
name "Rote Fabrik"), it subscribes to the "alternative" theme, for example to enter you have to climb over the
fence. Quite fun! Inside the area there's a restaurant, several bars and several venues for music. The whole
place was well kept and very clean, and the food was very good. Normal-to-low prices for Zürich standards.  
We first caught the tail of a show by "Tim & Puma Mimi", it's basically a swiss dude playing flute and electronic
music, and a japanese girl singing japanese vocals over it; it was... different, but really cool, and they had
a few very good songs.  
Later the main event was a rock-concert by "The Maccabees" in the big hall, which was really good, but I
personally preferred the opening band "Jamaica", they really had some awesome music there!  
Getting back home was quite an odissey too, as I managed to pretty much miss all the connections I could miss
and ended up waiting around for trains and stuff for hours, need to plan that better next time.  
And there will be a next time, as I really was positively impressed by the venue!
