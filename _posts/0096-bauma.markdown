Yesterday I went to [Bauma][1], a small village in the canton of ZÃ¼rich, where yearly in
October the "[Platform der Kleinserie][2]" takes place.
It's the premier fair in Switzerland for small producers of model trains in any scale,
as well as all types of accessories. Mostly high-quality brass models or other small
production or limited edition series can be found here.
As usual, the N scale was not that well represented, H0 clearly had most exhibitors
and customers, with 0 and 1 also having a significant following.
I had two main goals when walking out of my home that morning:
- see the swiss train signals manufactured by [Microscale][3].
- see the only manufacturer of the [SBB RABDe 500 "ICN"][4] in N scale, italian MD Trains.
I managed to do both successfully. The signals by Microscale are really well made, I'll
definitely order them there when I get to the point where I do need signals.
I also had a very nice conversation with Dario Morciano from MD Trains, it helped a lot
that we both spoke italian. His trains are beautifully made, on an order-by-order basis,
there are maybe 20 ICNs currently worldwide. Everything was truly lovely, also the models
of the SBB ETR 610, the ETR 470, and the BLS MUTZ were amazing. All train compositions
that a lot of people in the N scale communities I know of have been waiting for for years.
The price may be off-putting for many people, this kind of precision, hand-made small
production work is very expensive. I'd say about twice what one of the big manufacturers
would sell such trains at, if they ever get to actually producing them, but that doesn't
seem to be the case. For me, it was a more than acceptable price given the quality and
the opportunity to have an SBB ICN cruising on my layout, sometimes next year.
