The minutes of the PHP Herd's January meeting are now available, including a full log if anyone needs it.  
We elected herd leads, agreed on how to deal with the old-style PHP packages and discussed a number of ideas
like SLOTing of PHP minor version and some eclass changes, amongst other things.  
The next meeting will be on Tuesday 7th February 2006 at 19:00 UTC in #gentoo-php on irc.freenode.net. All are
welcome. If anyone has a topic they'd like to see on the agenda, please let a member of the PHP herd know.

Also, on a non-meeting-related note, we finally uploaded our [official PHP Herd page][1],
including up-to-date versions of our documentation (done by Andreask, great work and thanks!).
