I promised I'd blog this one... :P  
The other day I was in ZÃ¼rich with a friend of mine and she's a big Apple fan.  
As we were exiting a store, a family passed us and the store alarm system went off for them, no idea why.  
Still, my friend goes "I heard that can also happen if you've got an iPhone, together with some store security
systems!", to which I couldn't resist replying: "Well, sure, I mean, **the iPhone is a robbery!**" :D  
AHAHAHA epic comeback win! :P  
(Yeah, I don't like Apple products that much ;) )  
To conclude [some photos][1] from the [ASTAZ][2] Glows in the Dark party yesterday evening at [Dynamo][3], the
fluorescent light theme was really cool!
