PHP 5.1.0 is finally out!

And no, you won't see this in Portage anytime soon. It has a couple of problems that are being discussed over
at the php-dev mailinglist and it seems 5.1.1 will come out soon, we'll wait for 5.1.1 before considering its
addition to the Portage tree. For the ones who really want the bleeding-edge, try out the PHP 5.1.0 ebuild
we have in our [PHP Overlay][]. But don't complain if it breaks stuff, it's still in testing! ;)

Also, thanks to Stuart, we finally have php-select, the replacement for eselect-php, wich will be part of
the php-toolkit package.  
The next days will see a massive update of all new-style PHP related packages (dev-php4/* is already done),
and new revisions of dev-lang/php to fix a minor security problem and updates to use php-toolkit instead of
eselect-php. That's all for now, cu later!
