Yo! Greetings from the 23C3, the Chaos Computer Congress in Berlin.

Great talks and great people here, at the moment I'm attending a talk about JSON RPC (who knows, maybe that
can/will be used someday to improve SysCP), and before that I attended a really great talk about backbone
hacking. As you can see from this blog post, the wireless network works well (as does the wired one). :)

With regards to Gentoo devs, I've already seen and got to know hansmi, KillerFox and Pylon. I've also been
told that mabi is around and hanno should be too (at least based on the fact he gave a Lightning Talk about
XGL yesterday, which I sadly missed), we should really define a place to meet and get to know eachother...
That goes for Gentoo and SysCP users too.  
I myself can usually be found attending some talk or down in the Hackcenter (central position, at a round
table). Have fun!
