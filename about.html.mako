My name's Luca Longinotti, born 1988.

<br />
I currently live near Zürich, Switzerland, where I study Computer Science - Software Systems at the University of Zürich.
But I'm originally from Ticino, the southern part of Switzerland, bordering Italy. I thus speak Italian, German, French and, clearly, English.
<br />
<br />
I've always been interested in systems software, embedded systems, operating systems and networking.
<br />
If it's low-level, I like it! The lower, the better!

From 2005 to 2009 I was a Gentoo developer, working mainly on the various components of the LAMP stack, PHP and Apache primarly. It has been one
of the most learning-rich experiences of my life, where most of my Unix systems knowledge comes from. Teamwork and user support were also big
parts of the project, which I enjoyed immensely.
<br />
<br />
Over the years I've moved from mostly PHP coding, such as when I worked on SysCP and maintained the Gentoo PHP packages, to nowadays doing most
programming in Python and especially C, I truly, deeply love C as a language, and find its no-nonsense approach, where control truly lies with the
programmer, very refreshing. I kinda dislike the object-oriented hype, while I find OO and its paradigms often useful, I don't consider them a
solution to all possible problems, and don't try to fit everything into classes and patterns just because. As for all problems in life, careful
analysis and thinking things through will get you the answer, not the thoughtless application of pre-confectioned solutions.
<br />
I find that C heavily stimulates this approach, mostly by there being very little pre-confectioned available for thoughtless, random use.
By the way, if it doesn't have pointers, it's not worth it!
<br />
<br />
Currently my main project is Rig, a library of lock-free data-structures, and its supporting structure, like atomic_ops, headers for atomic
operations on a wide variety of architectures. My goal was to then, using the above, one day write a powerful and efficient web-server in C,
a revival of a Python project I started a few years ago called Furie. I still hope to get to this at some point!
<br />
<br />
I'm also starting to look into FPGAs and HDL programming, as an extension of my interest in embedded systems.
<br />
<br />
I also yearly spend a month with the Swiss Armed Forces, where I enjoy my position as company quartermaster sergeant. It's an interesting and
very varied job, whose rythms represent a real change from the usual routine, and it's helped by serving with quite a few excellent people.
<br />
<br />
Privately I enjoy reading a lot, in both senses: I very much enjoy it, and I practice lots of it! Mostly fantasy novels, such as The Lord of the Rings,
the Belgariad / Mallorean, A Song of Ice and Fire, The Mistborn. I also enjoy the cinematic versions of those novels, like the Game of Thrones
series, and generally good sci-fi (StarGate, Star Trek, Star Wars, Andromeda) and good crime/mystery (The Mentalist, Castle, Criminal Minds, CSI) series.
Of course, good comedy, anime and cartoons round up the offering: Family Guy, American Dad, Futurama, The Big Bang Theory and How I Met Your Mother
are just some examples. I usually prefer stories with a real, good, deep plot to those with lots of explosions, chaos and not much else.
<br />
<br />
Music-wise I'm into rock, hard-rock, pretty much any type of rock, as well as metal. I also love country, and modern instrumental classic
music holds a special place in my ears.
<br />
<br />
I enjoy good food, though maybe at times too much of it. ;-) As a consequence, I like and enjoy cooking. I'm especially good with desserts. A fine
wine from time to time completes the setting. In the end I could probably do with a little more physical exercise.
